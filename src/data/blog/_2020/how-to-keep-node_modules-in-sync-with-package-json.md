As a JS developer, while working on projects we frequently need to run `npm install` command on git pull or checkout to a different git branch where *package.json* is modified.

In majority of the cases, the dependencies won't cause any issues, but if there any breaking change introduced by the dependency packages then we need to do reinstall. We somehow forget to run the command (I mostly forget it at least ðŸ˜›).

How do we automate this?

Well, it quite simple. Hooks!!!

Yes. Git hooks.

We can make use git hooks to trigger `npm install` command if a *package.json* file has been modified.

**Script to run inside git hooks.**

```bash
#/usr/bin/env bash

changed_files="$(git diff-tree -r --name-only --no-commit-id ORIG_HEAD HEAD)"

check_run() {
	echo "$changed_files" | grep --quiet "$1" && eval "$2"
}

check_run package.json "npm install"
```

Here we check whether *package.json* file is present in the diff between the current HEAD and original HEAD. To learn more about refer to this [Q&A](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/964876/head-and-orig-head-in-git)

In order to do the magic,

1. Save the script with git hook name (eg. `post-merge`)
2. Make it executable by running `chmod +x {HOOK_NAME}`
3. Finally put the file into git hook by `mv {HOOK_NAME} .git/hooks/`

**Git Hooks**

- post\-merge -- Invoked by `git pull / git merge `
- post\-checkout -- Invoked by `git checkout / git clone`
