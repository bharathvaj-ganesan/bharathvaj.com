Ever wondered how the word **“blog”** came to be?

It all started in **1997**, when internet writer **Jorn Barger** coined the term **“weblog”** to describe the act of “logging the web” — collecting links, commentary, and thoughts about websites in a journal-like format.

Two years later, in **1999**, another blogger, **Peter Merholz**, playfully split the word into **“we blog”** in the sidebar of his site. The community liked it — and just like that, **“blog”** was born.

The term took off even more when the blogging platform **Blogger** launched in 1999, making it easy for anyone to share their thoughts online.

> So the evolution goes: **Weblog ➝ We blog ➝ Blog**

From a quirky term to a core part of internet culture — that’s the story behind the blog's name.
