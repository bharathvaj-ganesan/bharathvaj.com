If you're building modern web or mobile apps, chances are you've come across terms like **SSO**, **OAuth**, and **OpenID Connect (OIDC)**. While they often appear together, they serve different purposes. Here‚Äôs a quick breakdown:

### TL;DR

| Concept     | Purpose                        | Deals With      | Example                        |
|-------------|--------------------------------|------------------|--------------------------------|
| SSO         | One login for multiple apps    | Authentication   | Gmail + YouTube login         |
| OAuth       | Grant access to user data      | Authorization    | Access Google Drive           |
| OpenID Connect | Verify user identity       | Authentication   | "Login with Google" button    |

### ‚úÖ SSO (Single Sign-On)

**What it does:**  
Lets users log in **once** and access multiple apps without re-entering their credentials.

**Use case:**  
Login to Google once ‚Üí access Gmail, Drive, YouTube.

**Powered by:**  
Protocols like **SAML**, **OIDC**, or **Kerberos**.

**Purpose:**  
Simplifies authentication.

### üîÑ OAuth

**What it does:**  
Allows apps to access a user‚Äôs data **without** needing their password.

**Use case:**  
A calendar app accessing your Google Calendar.

**Powered by:**  
**OAuth 2.0** protocol.

**Purpose:**  
Secure **authorization** (not authentication).

---

### üîç OpenID Connect (OIDC)

**What it does:**  
Adds **authentication** on top of OAuth 2.0 ‚Äî it confirms the user's identity and provides their profile information.

**Use case:**  
Logging in to a third-party app with your Google account.

**Powered by:**  
**OAuth 2.0 + ID token** (a JWT containing user info).

**Purpose:**  
Handles **who the user is**, not just what data they can access.

### üß™ Real-World Example

1. **Login with Google** in your photo editing app:  
   ‚û§ This is **Social Login** using **OAuth + OpenID Connect**.

2. **Saving files to the user‚Äôs Google Drive** from your app:  
   ‚û§ This is **OAuth-based Authorization** to access Google Drive APIs.
