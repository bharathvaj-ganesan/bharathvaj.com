When youâ€™re starting to build an app for your startup, one common question is: **what kind of database should we use?**

My answer would be surprisingly simple:  
ðŸ‘‰ **Just go with a database youâ€™re most comfortable with.**

Whether it's **SQL** or **NoSQL**, your productivity matters the most in the early stages.

That said, **SQL databases** often have a slight edge:
- âœ… More mature
- âœ… Better for data analysis
- âœ… Higher fidelity
- âœ… Easier to use for many developers
- âœ… Still cost-effective

**NoSQL** can shine in cost-sensitive, unstructured scenarios â€” but unless you have a strong reason, SQL is a great starting point.

Start simple. You can always optimize later.

This meets the system design evaluation metrics that I've mentioned in [my previous blog](https://bharathvaj.com/posts/how-to-evaluate-system-design/).

Happy Building!.
