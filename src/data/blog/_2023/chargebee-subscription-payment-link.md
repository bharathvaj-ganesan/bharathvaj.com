If you're a business owner or a service provider, accepting online payments is crucial for your success. [Chargebee](https://www.chargebee.com/) is a popular subscription management platform that allows businesses to manage recurring payments and subscriptions seamlessly. One of the convenient features of Chargebee is the ability to create payment links, which can be easily integrated into your [Notion](https://www.notion.so/) website to streamline your payment collection process. In this blog, we'll walk you through the steps to integrate Chargebee payment links into your Notion website.

## Step 1: Set up a Chargebee Account

If you don't already have a Chargebee account, you'll need to sign up for one at [chargebee.com](http://chargebee.com/). It's free to create an account, and you'll need to provide some basic information about your business and bank account details for receiving payments.

## Step 2: Create a Payment Link in chargebee

Once you've set up your Chargebee account, you can create a payment link. Payment links allow you to generate a URL that you can share with your customers, and they can use it to make payments. Here's how you can create a payment link in Chargebee:

Log in to your Chargebee account and go to the "Configure Chargebee" tab.
Click on "Checkout & Self-Serve Portal" under Customer-Facing Essentials section.
Click the "Integrate with Chargebee" button.
Fill in the details for your payment link, such as the Product Family, Plan currency and frequency.
If you have any Addon or Charge that you want to include you can select from the dropdown.

## Step 3: Copy the Payment Link URL

Chargebee will automatically construct Payment link while updating the inputs. This is the link that you'll need to integrate into your Notion website to accept payments. Click the "Copy" button to copy the URL to your clipboard.

## Step 4: Add the Payment Link to Your Notion Website

Now that you have your payment link URL, you can add it to your Notion website. Here's how:

Open your Notion website in edit mode. Navigate to the page where you want to add the payment link and paste the link. You can customize the link text and color by clicking on the edit option from the hover menu.


## Step 5: Customize the Payment Link on Your Notion Website (Optional)

Once you've added the payment link to your Notion website, optionally you can customize how it appears to your customers. 

Go to [Butn One](https://butn.one/), a free Notion button widget utility to create a customisable embed. Add your button text and paste the Chargebee Payment Link in the button link option. Finally, you can customise the colour, font etc here that matches your website theme.

## Step 6: Test the Payment Link

Before making your Notion website live, it's important to test the payment link to ensure that it's functioning correctly. You can do this by clicking on the payment link on your Notion page and making a test payment using a valid credit card. This will help you verify that the payment link is working as expected and that payments are being processed successfully. You can also use Chargebeeâ€™s sandbox environment to test your integration.

## Step 7: Publish Your Notion Website

Once you've tested and confirmed that the payment link works, you can now publish your notion website. That's it. ðŸ˜Ž
